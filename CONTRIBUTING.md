## Making Changes

### Documentation Style

- Use clear, concise language

### Markdown Best Practices

- Use descriptive headers (`##`, `###`)
- Format code with triple backticks and language tags
- Use lists for sequential steps or grouped items

### Commit Message Guidelines

- Keep the first line under 72 characters
